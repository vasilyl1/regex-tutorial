# Regex Tutorial : matching an Email

Regex is a short for regular expression. When someone sees the Regex pattern at first, it may seem to look like a cryptic expressions. However, things change as soon as people start to understand how versatile and helpful the Regex can be when it is being used to define a specific search pattern.
Formally Regex is defined as the expression to be used to find pattenrs of characters within a string, find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string, or to validate an input if it is a string.

## Summary

This tutorial is aimed to describe one of the most commonly required expressions - matching an Email, which the author of this manual has been able to use a couple of times in the code while he was writing that manual.
Regex is considered a literal, so the pattern must be wrapped in slash characters (/). For matching correctly entered Email following should be true:

/^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$/

JavaScript has many useful methods which can be used with RegExp and String: 
Regular expressions are used with the RegExp methods test() and exec() and with the String methods match(), replace(), search(), and split().
Formal definitions and examples can be looked up at [MDN Web Docs](#https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).
